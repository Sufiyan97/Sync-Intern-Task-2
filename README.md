Building an OTP verification program using python 

Creating an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system involves generating a unique code that can be sent to a user's phone or email for verification. Below are the steps to create a basic OTP verification system using Python:

1:Generate a Random OTP:
Generate a random numerical code, typically of 6 or 8 digits, using a random number generator library. You can use the random module in Python to achieve this.

2:Send OTP to the User:
Use an appropriate method to send the generated OTP to the user's phone or email. You might use an SMS gateway, email API, or a messaging service for this step.

3:User Input and Verification:
Ask the user to input the OTP they received. Compare the entered OTP with the generated one to verify if it matches.
